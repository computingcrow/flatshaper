# Flatshaper

This is, first and foremost, a fun exercise in writing a game,
by creating a workable specialised engine and renderer (starting out with OpenGL3.3+ core).
It is planned to be a 2D platformer, if it does come to fruition.

### GLAD

Thanks to Dav1dde for providing this project's OpenGL extension loader code,
generated using the GLAD project. See https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad or https://glad.dav1d.de/

### Story

Maybe something along the lines of "Oh no, Ricewine has accidentally
spilled a jug of magic, and caused the world to curl into a cylinder.
Can you help him make the world flat again, lest it fall off the turtle?"
